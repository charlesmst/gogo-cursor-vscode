# GoGo Cursor: Cursor savepoints for vscode

This plugin let you save multiple savepoints between multiple documents

## Features

You can have multiple cursors pressing Ctrl + Alt + 1 To 9
When you change your cursor, the last cursor will be saved in the last position, and if the new position already exists, your cursor will move to that point

`Ctrl+Alt+1 to 10` or `Cmd+Alt+1 to 10` - Navigate between the cursors
`Ctrl+Alt+g` or `Cmd+Alt+g` - Save current cursor position and go to next
